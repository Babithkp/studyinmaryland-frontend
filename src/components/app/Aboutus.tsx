            Welcome to Study in Maryland, the premier international student
            recruitment program in Maryland, United States.
          </p>
          <p className="text-md my-5">
            Our program is commissioned by the state of Maryland to promote
            higher education in one of America's most vibrant and historic
            regions. The Study-In-Maryland scholarship initiative awards full
            scholarships to international students with a strong academic
            background to study an eligible degree program at a partner
            university in Maryland, USA.
          </p>
          <p className="text-md my-5">
            Our in-depth understanding of the importance of a multicultural
            community and the diverse, impactful contributions that
            international students have made in various cities across the United
            States drives our mission to promote the state of Maryland as a
            world-class study destination for international students.
          </p>
          <p className="text-md my-5">
            Since our inception in 2020, we have supported over 8,000
            international students to study at prestigious universities in
            Maryland through the Study-In-Maryland scholarship funded by state
            of Maryland and the Maryland state department of education.
          </p>
          <p className="text-md my-5 ">
            The privilege of studying in the United States is a golden
            opportunity that we believe all international students should have
            access to, and we are committed to making this continuously possible
            for graduate international students through the Study-In-Maryland
            scholarship.
