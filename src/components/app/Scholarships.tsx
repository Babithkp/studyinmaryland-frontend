            Overview
          </p>
          <p className="text-md my-5">
            The state of Maryland, in collaboration with public universities,
            has invested millions of dollars in the Study in Maryland
            scholarship initiative to support international students,
            particularly those from developing countries with limited financial
            resources. This scholarship initiative aims to help these students
            achieve their dream of studying in the United States. The
            scholarship program has significantly contributed to the influx of
            international students across various U.S. cities and represents a
            long-term investment plan, as international students have played a
            major role in shaping U.S. communities and economies over the past
            decade.
          </p>

          <p className="text-md my-5">
            The Study in Maryland scholarship aids up to 2,000 international
            students annually with fully funded scholarships to study a Masters
            or PhD degree program at a public university in the state of
            Maryland.
          </p>

          <p className="text-md my-5">
            To further enhance and promote opportunities for foreign students,
            our organization has partnered with the Maryland State Department of
            Education to offer the Study in Maryland scholarship. This
            scholarship is aimed at graduate international students with strong
            academic backgrounds who wish to study in Maryland.
